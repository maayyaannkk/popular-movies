# Popular Movies
As part of udacity curriculum

In this project, I have built an app to help users discover popular and recent movies.
It is a clean UI, syncs to a server, and presents information to the user.

##How to Install
###Requirements

Java 7/8
Latest version of Android SDK and Android Build Tools
API Key

The app uses themoviedb.org API to get movie information and posters. You must provide your own API key in order to build the app.

Just put your API key into lib/JSONParser.java file:

`public static final String API_KEY = ""; //Input api key in this string`


###Building

You can build the app with Android Studio or with ./gradlew assembleDebug command.
